Included in this folder are coding samples of my work at the University of Minnesota.

The projects included are the followings:

**Communication System**:

Used for communication and posting information for all staff memebers to read. This module was created for administrators to post important communication for staff members to read.
There is also the opportunity for staff to comment on postings.

Created to allow student-athletes and all staff members the opportunity to vote on student-athletes.

The system also calculated and displayed votes based on who voted.

**Credential System**:

This sytem allowed anyone to request credentials from Gopher Athletics to attend sporting events.
