# codesamples

Included in this folder are coding samples of my work at the University of Minnesota.

All main pieces of code were written by me during my time as  Assistant Director of IT.

The projects included are the followings:

## **Communication System**:

Used for communication and posting information for all staff memebers to read (created in a blog format). This module was created for administrators to post important communication for staff members to read.
There is also the opportunity for staff to comment on postings. This page is the home page for all staff in the Athletics department.

## **Voting Systems**:

Created to allow student-athletes and all staff members the opportunity to vote on student-athletes for the annual Golden Goldy Awards. Ballot includes images and top details of the athletes. System is designed for all browsers (uses Bootstrap).

The system also calculated and displayed votes based on who voted.

This sytem allows anyone (internal or external) to request credentials from Gopher Athletics to attend sporting events. 

It is updated every year to reflect that year's requirements.

## **Athletics Intranet Update 2017**:

This project was the largest that I completed at the University of Minnesota. Over 500 hours of work went into the build, design, and development of a new Intranet website built on a brand new server - all built from scratch. The overview of this project can be found [here] (http://www.athletics.umn.edu/technology1/development/shee0129/updateserver/).

## **Other code not included**

As head of programming, I am responsible for all code include on the Athletics Intranet (www.athletics.umn.edu). Although most of this code is locked down, it is available to be viewed on the website.

I am also responsible for all code found on the external site www.nothingshortofgreatness.com. This fundraising site was created for external communication regarding the raising and building of new buildings for the Athletes Village at the University of Minnesota.
